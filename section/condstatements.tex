\subsubsection{Conditional Statements}

The general syntax for conditional statements:
\begin{minted}{text}
-- When (If) statement
When [<condition>] [<body>]

-- When-ThatsWhen (If-else) statement
When [<condition>] [<body>]
ThatsWhen [<body>]

-- When with Thats (else-if) statement
When [<condition>] [<body>]
Thats [<condition>] [<body>]
ThatsWhen [<body>]
\end{minted}
\bd{Example 1:}
\begin{minted}{text}
-* Simple leap year checker *-
year = 2023; result = bool;
When [year % 4 == 0] [
    When [year % 100 == 0] [
        When [year % 400 == 0] [
            result = The1;
        ] Thats [year % 400 != 0] [
             result = The0;
        ]
    ] ThatsWhen [
        result = The1;
    ]
] ThatsWhen [
    result = The0;
]
SpeakNow[result];
\end{minted}
Output:
\begin{minted}{text}
The0
\end{minted}
\bd{Example 2:}
\begin{minted}{text}
x = 5;
When [x = 5] [
    SpeakNow[“The value of the variable is 5”];
] Thats [x > 5] [
    SpeakNow[“The value of the variable is greater than 5”];
] ThatsWhen [
    SpeakNow[“The value of the variable is less than 5”];
]
\end{minted}
Output:
\begin{minted}{text}
The value of the variable is 5
\end{minted}
