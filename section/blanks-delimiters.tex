\subsection{Blanks or Spaces}
In TaylorScript, blank spaces are optional syntax for code readability.

\subsection{Delimiters}
\begin{itemize}
\item \bd{Square brackets} (\cd{[]}) for block scope and enclosing condition and iterative statements header
\item \bd{Semicolon} (\cd{;}) for ending a statement
\item \bd{Curly brackets} (\cd{\{\}}) for declaring array list
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Free-and--fixed-field Formats}
TaylorScript, like any other modern programming languages, is a free-form language. The position of statements is not significant. Statements can start in any column. Multiple statements in one line are also accepted, given that they are separated with semicolons.
