\subsection{Blanks or Spaces}
In TaylorScript, blank spaces are optional syntax for code readability.

\subsection{Delimiters}
The main delimiter for the program is square brackets (\cd{[]}). This is for block scope and enclosing conditional statements and loop headers.

\subsection{Free-and--fixed-field Formats}
TaylorScript, like any other modern programming languages, is a free-form language. The position of statements is not significant. Statements can start in any column. Multiple statements in one line are also accepted, given that they are separated with semicolons.
